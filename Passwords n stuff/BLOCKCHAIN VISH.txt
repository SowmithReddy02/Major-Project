A cryptocurrency exchange app that uses swapping of two different valued tokens named EVT and DVT, and how it is implemented using Flutter frontend, Infura for smart contract integration, and Solidity for writing smart contracts:

The cryptocurrency exchange app is designed to provide users with the ability to trade or swap tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. In this app, two tokens are supported: EVT and DVT. EVT and DVT are ERC-20 tokens, which means they are built on the Ethereum blockchain and follow the ERC-20 standard for token implementation.

The frontend of the app is developed using Flutter, a popular cross-platform framework for building mobile applications. Flutter allows for the creation of a seamless user interface that enables users to interact with the app's functionalities easily. The app's frontend communicates with the Ethereum blockchain using Infura.

Infura is a service that provides access to the Ethereum network without the need for users to run their own Ethereum node. It acts as a bridge between the app's frontend and the Ethereum blockchain. By connecting to Infura, the app can interact with the smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum network.

The smart contracts that power the swapping functionality of the app are written in Solidity. Solidity is a programming language specifically designed for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum platform. The smart contracts define the rules and logic for token swapping, including price calculation, token balances, and transfer functions.

The app's main features include:
1. Displaying the current price of Ethereum (ETH): The app fetches the current price of ETH from an external data source or a decentralized oracle and displays it to the users. This helps users determine the value of their tokens and make informed trading decisions.

2. Swapping tokens: Users can initiate token swaps by specifying the amount of EVT or DVT they want to exchange. The app calculates the exchange rate based on the current price of ETH and the respective values of EVT and DVT tokens. The smart contract ensures that the swap is executed securely and transparently.

3. Showing token balances: The app provides users with the ability to view their token balances for EVT and DVT. This allows users to keep track of their holdings and make informed decisions while trading.

Overall, the app aims to provide a user-friendly and secure platform for users to swap tokens and manage their token balances. It leverages Flutter for a seamless frontend experience, Infura for smart contract integration, and Solidity for implementing the core functionalities of the smart contracts.
